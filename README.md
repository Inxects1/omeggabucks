## âœ¨ Features

* **Persistent Balances:** All player currency balances are automatically saved and loaded across server restarts, ensuring a stable economy.
* **Player-to-Player Transactions:** Players can easily send (`!pay`) and request (`!request`) currency from each other, fostering player interaction and trade.
* **Temporary In-Game IDs:** Simplifies transactions by assigning short, unique 2-digit IDs to online players, usable in commands instead of full names or Brickadia IDs.
* **Comprehensive Admin Controls:** Server administrators have full power to `add`, `remove`, or `set` any player's currency balance.
* **Configurable Currency Name:** Easily change the name of your currency (e.g., "Coins", "Credits", "Gems") through the plugin's configuration.
